# Anti-Duplicator

Program prints duplicate files in specified directory and all nested directories (if any)

# Quickstart

Program requires one argument - directory path to be searched for duplicates

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash
$ python duplicates.py <path to directory>

File 'settings.json' appears 5 times:
        ../7_mistery_fix/.vscode/settings.json
        ../5_lang_frequency/.vscode/settings.json
        ../11_duplicates/.vscode/settings.json
        ../4_json/.vscode/settings.json
        ../3_bars/.vscode/settings.json
```
